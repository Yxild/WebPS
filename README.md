# Welcome
Welcome to the offical repo for WebPS, it's a utility created by Lithium Development & Contributors.
This utility is a Easy-To-Use utility meant for various stuff e.g. Jailbreaking, Firmwares 'n more!


# Why this utility?
Honestly, no reason but I don't see enough contributions to PS3 and PS4 anymore so I'm creating a utility which is able to multiple stuff like Firmware Downloading, Jailbreak (HEN) and more.

I'm wanting to hope more people will actually contribute to this utility at some point, the source will soon be opened after what ever we do.
